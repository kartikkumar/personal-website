I am an Aerospace Engineer and Planetary Scientist. I've worked on a variety of projects, ranging from the design of space missions to the modeling and simulation of planetary rings.

I'm one of the co-founders at satsearch.co, successfully incubated at the European Space Agency's Business Incubation Centre in Noordwijk, the Netherlands.

In 2010, I initiated an on-going, open-source project, to develop a toolbox for astrodynamics simulations (Tudat): https://github.com/tudat.

I'm building a new collection of low-level, open-source libraries for space simulation: https://github.com/openastro

I worked as an Experienced Researcher within the Stardust network (EC FP7 Marie Curie ITN), leading projects to develop and design technologies for active debris removal.

From 2015 to 2019, I was an Analog Astronaut for the Austrian Space Forum's Mars simulation missions.
