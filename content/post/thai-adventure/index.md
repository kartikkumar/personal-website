Keeping with the cooking spirit yesterday after lunch, I tackled Thai food for dinner. I think having Indian blood in me, enjoying Thai food is just part of my make up. There is so much to like about good Thai food, and even though at times it's difficult to get real vegetarian food in Thai restaurants that doesn't have fish sauce, shrimp paste etc., when you do get it, it's a real treat. My mom considers it a big treat, and so I decided, after having spent the last year absolutely not cooking so that I don't miss the chance to eat my mom's great food, that it was time to treat her.

I'd made Thai food before, but that was a while back, and I wasn't sure how it would turn out. I also distinctly remember following another recipe for Thai Yellow Curry, so that made me a little apprehensive. In the end though, it turned out just fine. I decided to complete the Yellow Curry, with a soup, which, in theory was a good decision, given the cold weather, but I ended up picking a soup that was almost EXACTLY the same as the Yellow Curry in terms of flavour :S. Nevertheless, it was quite tasty too.

My mom has asked me to make something next week ... do I stick with the Thai theme and try something else (red curry, green curry, pad thai etc.?), or do I switch continents and try something Mexican? Decisions, decisions ...
