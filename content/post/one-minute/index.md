Tragedy
Rips through a million lives.

One minute

Silence

A fallen loved one,
A departed friend,
A soul set free.

<!-- more -->

This life is unfair,
Nay it's a bitch.

Why does the world not stop?
Why does it not cease to exist?

Hustle and bustle,
Through the busy streets.

An hour,
A day,
A lifetime,
Why one minute?
