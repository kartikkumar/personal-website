_When nature blossoms,
Earth expresses love,
intangible yet recognisable.

The relentless rustling of trees,
trickling of water between rocks,
exposes harmony and melody,
provides glimpses of perfection.

This idyllic beauty,
is only surpassed by the radiance,
you bring to my life.

Love so strong, it wilts the will of all that oppose it.
Love so deep, it takes me to places beyond the physical realm.
Love so commanding, it captures my every sense.

I take a moment to reflect,
and it reaffirms my faith,
that you and I are meant to be._
