This weekend I'm participating in Yes!Delft's [1-2-Launch weekend startup program](http://www.yesdelft.nl/nl-nl/voorondernemers/launchlab/12launchstartupweekend.aspx). It's been an absolutely blast and I'm completely psyched about the business we're launching!

It's been a great experience getting out on the street and figuring out what problems people are facing and want solved. 

Enter GoUrbanGrow, your houseplant saviour! Our vision is a world in which houseplants don't die for dumb reasons. Our mission, should you choose to accept us, is to help you save them :). 

Anyway, tomorrow we are pitching to the 1-2-Launch jury and the winner (there's always a winner!) is given the opportunity to take part in Yes!Delft's brilliant [Launchlab](http://www.yesdelft.nl/nl-nl/voorondernemers/launchlablandingspage(nlnl).aspx) program.

We want to win of course!

So if you're intrigued, visit us at http://gourbangrow.com and leave us your email address to learn more!

Thanks for listening :)
