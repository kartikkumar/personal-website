It's been a long while since I've updated this website. For a number of reasons, I have not been motivated enough to maintain the website on a regular basis. I am however resolved to doing so from this moment forwards, so hopefully you'll see plenty more updates here on a more regular basis! Various things have happened since I last updated this website.

I completed a 5-month internship at Instituto de Ciencias FÃ­sicas in Cuernavaca, Morelos, Mexico from January to May 2010. This has led to plenty of fruitful research and collaboration, with hopefully a number of journal papers in the pipeline!

I continued my main line of research in Delft and presented my work and progress on a number of occasions (see the Publications page to view the conference presentations and internal group presentations). I was also involved in initiating a project within the Astrodynamics and Satellite missions group in Delft to setup a C++ astrodynamics library through collaborative effort. This took up a fair amount of time, but hopefully we are now entering a stage where everyone is seeing the fruits of working on such a library jointly. The project website can be found at: tudat.tudelft.nl.

As of 1st of October, 2010, after having jumped through plenty of administrative hoops, I finally made the move to Berkeley that had been planned since the beginning of my PhD. I am now currently working on my research as an Assistant Specialist at the Center for Integrative Planetary Sciences at University of California-Berkeley. My office is located in the Astronomy department building. My stay here is planned for two years, although this is subject to review based on the status of my research. I will be traveling back and forth to Delft during my stay here, with my next trip back planned for the 5th of February, 2010.

Unfortunately, the review of my first journal paper submission (Lunar Weak Capture Trajectories: Stability and Relation to Invariant Manifolds) based on my MSc thesis work was that it would require major revisions before being accepted to be published. As a consequence, I have had to put this on the backburner, but will hopefully be able to return to it in the near future.
