For the last six months or so, I've been working in a team to bring the SpaceUp concept to The Netherlands. SpaceUp is a movement that's spreading around the world like wildfire ([SpaceUp.org](http://spaceup.org)). The concept behind SpaceUp is to provide a platform for discussions about the past, present and future of the space industry.

Most space conferences follow the traditional one-to-many format. This serves the purpose of disseminating technical and scientific results, but is far from ideal for open-ended discussions. Typically, a lot of the most interesting discussions at traditional space conferences occur in the hallways, at breaks, at conference dinners etc. SpaceUp aims to capture the mood of these exchanges, placing them firmly in the spotlight.

Essentially, SpaceUp is geared towards delivering a many-to-many platform. Through SpaceUp NL, we are looking to stimulate discussion about the space industry in The Netherlands and beyond. Unlike traditional conferences, we are also aiming to cater to a wide audience, with professionals, students, and amateurs equally welcome to share thoughts. Further, SpaceUp follows the "unconference" format, with the schedule largely filled out during the two days by the participants (through the session grid). This makes for fun-filled, engaging and inspiring discussions!

Check out the following video that describes SpaceUp in a nutshell:

I've had a great time co-organizing SpaceUp NL with the rest of the organizing team (Susanne, Jacco, and Fred). We've been busy with a million things, including arranging the venue and catering, seeking out sponsorship opportunities, setting up the website, and much more! Things are coming together nicely and we're gearing ourselves for a fantastic two days!

SpaceUp NL 2014 will be held during the weekend of the 10th and 11th of May, 2014 at Space Expo (ESA/ESTEC visitor center). We have room for 100 participants in total. Registration is now open and tickets are selling rapidly!
