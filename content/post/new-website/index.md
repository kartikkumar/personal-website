Finally, I decided to migrate to a Wordpress-based site. I hope this means that I'll be more motivated to keep the content here updated more frequently. 

There's plenty to report since my last post, almost a year ago. Things have progressed quite a lot, with some positive and some more negative moments in the last 12 months.

My aim is to keep these posts short and sharp, so for now, that's it!
