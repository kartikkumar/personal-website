I'm not one generally for working from home. I find it quite isolating, and, when you're sitting in the suburbs, downright boring at times. There are a number of benefits though. Staying out of the cold is great, but above all, having your kitchen at your disposable to whip up something tasty beats eating at the Sodexo cafeteria at Aerospace Engineering 10 out of 10 times (would be 11 out of 10 if that was possible!).

And so, I sit here, enjoying a taste of Italy. Pasta pesto (with fresh pesto made near Genoa), with pine nuts, porcini mushrooms and a healthy sprinkling of fresh parmesan cheese ... mmmm, maybe this isn't conducive to working at home after all ...
